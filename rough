Natasha Khurrana
Indian, 22 
A self taught artist since the beginning, I have always had 
 interest and have been passionate about art since my childhood. 
Born and brought up in Delhi, I have always had interest and  
and felt immense happiness while practicing painting on the walls  
of my house. Developing my art skills over the years, I now feel  
that I am ready to showcase my talent into this beautiful world out there. 
Thus, here I am!
