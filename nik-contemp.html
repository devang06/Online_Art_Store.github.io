          Jardim Gramacho, a 321-acre plot of land on the northern edge of Rio de Janeiro, was the world’s largest garbage dump until it closed in 2012. Between 2007 and 2010, the Jardim became a kind of studio for Brazilian-born, New York- and Rio-based artist Muniz. The artworks created there became a series
           called Pictures of Garbage, which recreate iconic images from art history using trash collected from the dump.</p>

            Art Description:<br>
            Upon entering the Tate’s Turbine Hall, visitors to Eliasson’s The weather project were greeted by a huge glowing orb that hovered near the ceiling. A fine mist filled the hall, diffusing its spellbinding glow throughout the room. Because this work by the Danish-Icelandic artist effectively used the entire volume of the space, it was called the largest indoor contemporary
             artwork ever produced. The installation became a phenomenon, and over two million people visited during its run. </p>

              On May 12, 2008, a 7.9-magnitude earthquake devastated Sichuan Province in western China, killing thousands of young students whose schools may not have met country-wide building standards. The government refused to investigate, and Chinese artist and activist Ai was compelled to act. The son of a poet who was denounced and exiled by the Chinese government, he had made a career out of creating artworks promoting freedom of
               expression and human rights, and in the process, challenging Chinese cultural values and political authority.</p>
